All garments are carefully deconstructed and reconstructed into higher value and better quality products by our in-house team which allows us to maintain transparency and high ethical standards. We primarily upcycle overstocked garments, defected garments or returned garments.</p>

                                        Once production is complete and garments have been through our quality check process, we send the newly made garments back to the brands to be sold and we sustainably dispose of any excess materials that we are unable to utilise.

                                        This is a sustainable brand but we also explore the vast possibilities of what can be created.
